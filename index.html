  <h2>Systematics and evolution</h2>
  <p>Scientific information about penguins</p>

  <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
  <p>The family name of Spheniscidae was given by <strong>Charles Lucien Bonaparte</strong> from the genus
    Spheniscus,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> the name of that genus
    comes from the
    Greek word <em>σφήν sphēn "wedge"</em> used for the shape of
    an African penguin's swimming flippers.<sup><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></p>
  <h3>Evolution</h3>
  <p>Although the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Sphenisciformes is well-researched, many prehistoric forms
    are not fully described. Some seminal articles about the evolutionary history of penguins have been published since
    2005.</p>

  <h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
  <p>Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in
    the air. In the water, however, <em>penguins are astonishingly agile</em>. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to
    birds'
    flight in the air. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring
    buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to
    maintain balance for their upright stance. </p>
